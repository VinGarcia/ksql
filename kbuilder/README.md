# Welcome to the Keep It Simple Query Builder

This is the Keep It Simple query builder created to work
either in conjunction or separated from the KSQL package.

## Warning: Experimental package

kbuilder is new and might be subject to breaking changes, so if you want
to experiment with this tool know that updating it might require manual changes
to the code

## TODO List

- Add support to Update and Delete operations
- Improve support to JOINs by adding the `tablename` tag to the structs
- Add error check for when the Select, Insert and Update attrs are all empty
